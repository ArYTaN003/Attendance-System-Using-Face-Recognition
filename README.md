# Attendance System Using Face Recognition
## Download the attendance_system.py script, there is no frontend for now, and ensure that you update the path incase you want to use images and data, in some other location.
## By default, the student/employee details will be taken from a .csv file named "Data.csv" and the images will be taken from a folder named "ImageData".
